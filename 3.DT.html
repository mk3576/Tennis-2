<p>Dominic Thiem (German pronunciation: [ˈdɔmɪnɪk ˈtiːm];[2] born 3 September 1993) is an Austrian professional tennis player. He has been ranked as high as world No. 3 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals, which he first achieved in March 2020. He is the second-highest ranked Austrian player in history, behind former world No. 1 Thomas Muster. He has won 17 ATP Tour singles titles, including one Grand Slam title at the 2020 US Open where he came back from two sets down to defeat Alexander Zverev in the final. With the win, Thiem became the first male player born in the 1990s to claim a Grand Slam singles title, as well as the first Austrian to win a US Open singles title. He had previously reached three other Grand Slam finals, losing at the 2018 and 2019 French Open to Rafael Nadal, and at the 2020 Australian Open to Novak Djokovic. Thiem was also the runner-up of the 2019 and 2020 ATP Finals, where he lost to Stefanos Tsitsipas and Daniil Medvedev respectively.

As a junior, Thiem was ranked as high as No. 2 in the world. He qualified for the 2011 French Open Boys' final, and won the 2011 Orange Bowl. As a professional, he broke into the top 100 for the first time in 2014. In 2015, he won his first ATP title at the 2015 Open de Nice Côte d'Azur in France. The next year he reached his first Grand Slam semifinal at the 2016 French Open. By doing so, he for the first time rose into the top ten of the world rankings, where he has since been a permanent fixture. He went on to reach his first ATP Tour Masters 1000 final in 2017 at the Madrid Open, before reaching his first Grand Slam final the following year. Thiem won his first Masters 1000 title at the 2019 Indian Wells Masters, beating Roger Federer in the final.

Thiem has some of the biggest groundstrokes of the tour, consistently hitting big with both his forehand and his single handed backhand. Generally thought of as a baseliner he has added more variety with the use of slice backhand and more netplay since adding coach Nicolás Massú to his team in March 2019. At 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in), he possesses a serve reaching up to 145 miles per hour (233 km/h), which he often uses to set up effective one-two punches. He won the Austrian Sportsman of the Year award for 2020, the fourth time a tennis player has won the award since its creation in 1949.</p>
